# SortedArrayClass
This is a C++ implementation of a sorted array of unsigned integers class. It provides all necessary default, copy and move constructors and destructor.
Also it provides implementation for the following overloaded operators: assignment (=), index ([]), equality (==), and stream output (<<),
while making use of the move semantics where appropriate and providing error reporting to the client programmers.
It also assures that with any operation, the array remains sorted.
